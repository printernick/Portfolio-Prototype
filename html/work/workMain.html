      Summer iD tech is a STEM summer program that teaches young
      students tech curriculum. My role was a tutor where I had to
      prepare and teach a week long course. I also had to manage
      and facilitate these students to adhere to camp guidelines.
      I worked alongside a team of other talented instructors to cultivate a
      fun and educational environment. Some courses I taught include:
      "Assemble Your Take-Home Laptop and Code in Python,"
      "Cybersecurity and Encryption," and "Python Coding and AI with Take-Home Cozmo."

        The Campus Village housing community hired a small board to
        organize successful, creative programs and events for the community.
        One event in particular was designing our very own escape room
        for residents. We had puzzles and hints around our community center
        and I thought it would be an interesting idea to have a small
        text-based game as one of the puzzles to escaping. I coded
        it in Python and utilized classes and inheritance to represent
        rooms and items within the game.
