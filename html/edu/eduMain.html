    <p> I recently graduated from UC Irvine in June of 2019 with a
      Bachelor's for Computer Science. While studying there, I learned
      all sorts of things such as coding languages like Python, C++, and
      Java. I also took courses in data structures, algorithms, computer
      networking, and many others. Take a look at some of the courses I have
      taken: </p>

    <p> During 2012-2016, I took additional community college courses at San Joaquin
      Delta College while also attending my high school courses. This allowed me to finish
      many of my GE's and graduate from UC Irvine within 3 years. Check out my transcript
      from San Joaquin Delta College: </p>
