      I joined a dance team! I had never danced seriously with choreography
      before, so it was a really fun and challenging experience. I was
      not completely comfortable at first, but I stuck with it and
      improved a lot! Check out some of our performances.

      I also really enjoy making (and watching) films! I have not made
      as many as I would have liked to recently but check out some short films
      I made with some amazing teams.
