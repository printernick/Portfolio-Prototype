      I am a recent graduate experienced in mobile, web, back-end, and full stack development.
      I have used tools such as Android Studio, Bootstrap, and mySQL.
      Throughout my courses I have learned and used many programming langues such as Python, C++, C, Java, HTML,
      CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, and PHP. I also am familiar with developing web applications and utilizing REST services.
      I am interested in an entry level position for software engineering.
